# Restaurant_Data_Prediction

Welcome to the official repository for my internship tasks completed as part of the Cognifyz Technologies Data Science Internship. This repository contains the completed and processed Jupyter Notebooks for Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 tasks.

**Project Overview**
During the internship, I worked on various real-world data science problems involving data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

ðŸ”¹ **Level 1: Introduction to Data Processing**
Focused on basic data loading, cleaning, and analysis.

Covered exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas and seaborn/matplotlib.

Introduced visual summaries like histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.

ðŸ”¹ **Level 2: Intermediate Analytics & Visualization**
Emphasis on deeper data wrangling, grouping, and trend analysis.

Used visual storytelling techniques to communicate insights.

Involved use of grouped bar charts, advanced plotting, and feature engineering.

ðŸ”¹ **Level 3: Predictive Modeling**
Built and evaluated machine learning models using scikit-learn.

Tasks included classification, model evaluation, and metrics interpretation.

Included train-test splitting, confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
